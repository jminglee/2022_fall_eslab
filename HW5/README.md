## Usage
1. Install software for Logic Analyzer [here](https://www.zeroplus.com.tw/logic-analyzer_tw/products.php?pdn=1&product_id=239).
2. Follow the tutorial and complete the circuit layout between the logic analyzer, the STM32 board and your laptop/PC.
3. Import the [PWM example](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-snippet-PwmOut_ex_3) into Mbed Studio.
4. Replace ```main.cpp``` with the file of the same name in this repository.
5. Build and run, then observe the waveform in the logic analyzer.
